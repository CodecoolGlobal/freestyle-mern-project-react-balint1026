# Eventify

Welcome to Eventify! Eventify is a platform where users can host events or join events hosted by others. It provides a live chat function to communicate with other attendees during the event. This application is built using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js.

## Features

- Host and join events.
